No tiene nada que ver con racismo, aunque √©se es el enfoque que quieren darle para evadir las cr√≠ticas y el error que hicieron.
√âsa no es Ariel lo siento mucho por Disney pero trat√°ndo de ser inclusivos echaron a perder la versi√≥n original, Si quieren ser inclusivos de verdad p√≥nganse creativos y hagan proyectos nuevos con nuevas princesas de los colores que quieran mucha inteligencia no sirve de nada ya que tienen poca creatividad.
A la fuerza quieren meter la inclusi√≥n y todo tipo de g√©neros en fin, al final la Educaci√≥n de los ni√±os y ni√±as y la responsabilidad est√° en nosotros los padres no se confundan por favor no se necesita de Disney para educar bien a nuestros ni√±os y ni√±as."

The cartoon is still caucasian, this movie is not the cartoon which means it can be anything color person in it. Meaning green, red, black, white, caucasian or whatever. In real life a mermaid is not caucasian or black either way. Maybe some of you not raciest maybe it's a mental thing of wanting things to stay the same. But change needs to come to this world I wanna see new things anyway in a movie. I might not watch it but still. I dont really watch nowadays movies. I watch some if I think they're good but I like old movies. They feel more real than the movies nowadays. Like they made from puppets and all kinds of stuff. Nowadays stuff too animated."

"Is white wasing in movies okey? No. Diversity and inclusion in movies is good? Sure.

Soo.. to all you people who believe anyone who takes issue with this movie is a racist. I would like for you to think about that for just a little bit.

How in the world can you say race swapping is no problem as long as it's a white character being swapped for a black one? Is ""black washing"" the way forward? Is it justified simply because white people did it? Is that equality? Really?

Can't you not see my point?
Race swapping is not ever okay, period.
I know shes not a human being, allright. She is an animated mythical sea creature. I am fully aware of this.
But she sure looks like a white girl to me. Yes, a white ginger girl with a fish tail. But white none the less. She has pale skin, blue eyes and red hair. Okay. She does not have dark skin and orange dread looks.

I think she is beautiful and have a great voice. But she just doesn't resemble the original at all. And I happen to think that staying true to the original portrayal of Ariel is important. And I'm sure many people of all ethnicities agree. This is NOT racist. Her race should not and does not matter in my opinion. But this choice to simply make her not white for whatever reason whatsoever. THAT sure seems racist to me.

If you think it's not okay to replace a black character with a white one but totally  fine the other way around. Then YOU are the racist here. Or you are just plain stupid. Simple as that."

"As of this post there are two million nine hundred thousand dislikes for this video.  I guess they don't want to be part of Disney's world.  If you turn off a customer, how many future subscriptions, Blurays, park visits, do you miss out on?  I mean, if you convince three million people to not do Disney again, what's the financial damage for disney?  If the average parent shells out a hundred dollars on disney products, that means 3 million lost customers would represent a 300 million dollar loss for the company.  But of course the average parent spends FAR more than a hundred dollars.  When you factor in $10 monthly channel subscriptions for six or seven years, toys, videos, and the odd $3k park visit the average parent may well spend in excess of $5k on Disney.  So if they lose three million of those $5k parents we're talking about a possible loss in the FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLAR range for Disney.  Maybe the true number is double or triple that.  And that's what they mean by get woke go broke, boys and girls."

"In my opinion:

1. The underwater environment looks lifeless and gloomy. No color at all. Even in the OG movie, Ariel's hair and tail color still popped against the all blue backdrop.

2. I have long hair, and I used to swim every summer. Hair rarely moves/stays like that underwater. It flows with the current.

3. There are no bubbles effects, which helped to sell the underwater feel of the first movie. Bubble effects help demonstrate that underwater creatures are alive because they breathe in a way.

Sorry if this is a bit harsh. I just want to be honest."
