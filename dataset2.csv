I guess my biggest question would be why couldn‚Äôt they just do a remake of the princess and the frog which was a really cool movie because it‚Äôs original character was black it would‚Äôve been a good representation for the black community
"The part where Ariel says ""hey my og story was a gay metaphor and my og disney movie was basically one too and hey I have always been a metaphor for marginalized groups so maybe get your panties out of a twist just because I am not white"" was my favorite part"

"The part when the little mermaid said ""Maya hee Maya hoo Maya haa Maya haha dragosta numa numa ye numa numa ye"" I cried so bad"
The part where Ariel sung the beatbox version of Better Call Saul's theme was the most emotionally beautiful part of the movie.
Let's Go Halle!! Can't wait!!
when ariel said ‚ÄúWOLLT IHR DEN TOTALEN KRIEG?‚Äù I knew something fishy was going to happen. Truly one of the ww2 documentaries of all time.

"I'm gonna get a skin transplant so I can say ""she's just like me"" It's truly an amazing film. I don't need to watch it to know because the actual quality of the film means nothing anymore, I only care about ticking boxes"
The part where the little mermaid said ‚Äútalk to me goose‚Äù was incredibly moving
"Looks like another movie that has nothing to offer but nice CGI and diversity. 
While I don't mind either, there's more to a good movie or show than that! ü´Ä"

Changing the race of an existing famous character instead of making a new character just so that they can get much more appeal to the larger black children is just feels so cheap on Disney's part.
"We grew up with light-skinned Ariel. It was a part of my childhood.. 
It's just weird to have dark skin with red hair..
And she lives under the sea, so her skin should be pale. Or maybe tan because too much sun?
Might as well play Mulan as a white person.. :/"
Looks like a DC movie rather than a Disney movie üòÇ lol
Im not raciste but why !!!! This is not ariel üò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢
The part where ariel said:  I‚Äôm gonna make him an offer he can‚Äôt refuse It gives me goosebumps feeling this will be the best movie of all time
Imagine if they made Tiana white next
"the part where Ariel says "" i'm gonna be the pirate king "" gave me chills"
"""That's not Ariel*."
Cultural appropriation.
"When Ariel said ""Nano machines son! They harden in response to physical trauma. You can't hurt me, Jack!"" I felt chills down my spine"

Why is ariel half black ?

Can she say N word to prince now
Something is.......off about this mermaid
I love the part where Ariel is singing 'Island in the sun' by Weezer in a watertower.
"But now my question is that ""will the prince and king  and all his community be black"" with consideration for the mermaid."
Wow this made me cry
"The part where Ariel says: ""Come with me if you want to live"" just made me burst into tears"
"Classic should stay classic, progress is created by new in the life."
"The part where ariel said ""it can't be bargained with, it can't be reasoned with, it doesn't feel pity or remorse and it will not stop until you are dead"" made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside"
The Wokeness and virtue signaling is getting ridiculous
"The part where Ariel said ""I am your father"" brought tears to my eyes. Absolutely magnificent!"
Why she black
I loved the part where Gabrielle starts singing and I can‚Äôt wait to see who is going to play Ariel on this movie! Great idea of Disney to make diversity representation with characters that already exist in their world.
"The part where she said - 'im a silent guardian, the watchful protector, the little mermaid' sent shivers down my spine"

The part where the little mermaid said ‚ÄúIt's not who I am underneath but what I do defines me‚Äù made me cry my heart out.

She looks adorable and her voice is gorgeous! I'm sure she'll do great!
"The part where Ariel says ""I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit, it's the only way to be sure"" is a fantastic, eloquent, and rich representation of modern day writing"

"The part where Ariel said to Jack ""I'll never let go, I promise"" just made me burst into tears. Truly one of the best movie trailers of all time."
Y‚Äôall are literally arguing over a mythical creature that don‚Äôt exist. Grow up. It‚Äôs not that serious. You Don‚Äôt like the idea of Ariel being black then don‚Äôt watch it. Simple. You wanna see Ariel white then how about you become a producer or whatever and make that happen otherwise just hush and accept the fact that they made her black. You can‚Äôt change it so whats the point of whining about it. Grow up.
so beautiful waiting it to cone out

The line where the little mermaid said 'any true revolution is born out of love' gave me such goosebumps I had a seizure.
"The part where Ariel says ""Because I am the mermaid Gotham deserves But not the one it needs right now. So, they hate me. Because I can take it. Because I'm is not our hero- a silent Guardian A watchful protector. The mermaid."" tears down my appendix."

"the movie that will be a box office flop, Disney in its stupid attempt to want to erase its racist past so easily fools progressives"
"So besides my aforementioned comments; this is what I have to say about this movie. It's marketed towards children and it's original story was written by Hans Christian Andersen. (as I understand it anyways) The way I'm seeing it at this very moment is they have only race swapped the Ariel character to appease the ""Woke"" mob and score brownie points with the loony lefties and to satisfy their stupid agenda. I just don't understand why they had to make this all about race (they can say that they didn't but it's ridiculously obvious this is what they have done). If Disney decided to recast Black Panther and use let's say Zac Efron as T'Challa could you imagine?? They would riot!!! But it would never happen because they can recast as many Black, Asian or whatever other race into traditionally white roles; but they would NEVER DARE cast white people into traditionally black or Asian roles"
Cant wait

"The line where Ariel says, Engage Mr Crusher , warp 6."
I loved the part where the mermaid said ‚ÄúNot my president‚Äù. I am still crying of joy.
The part where Ariel says the part

"Looks like she took lessons from Beyonce and added unnecessary runs.

"The part where Ariel said, ‚ÄúThe FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues.

The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.‚Äù had me in tears. I was so moved"
"I don't think this is gonna be good. Not every Disney movie needs to be live action. It cool they changed her look but I think they should have recreated it in a Pixar computer animation style like the movie Luca did. That said I hope it's good, I'm happy to see it's made alot of people happy."
I disliked this because Disney could have come up with a black mermaid character using African folklore culture. It's the best way to represent others by their heritage.
"The part where Ariel said ""Nanomachines, son! They harden¬†in response to physical trauma! You can't hurt me, Ursula!"" Gave me goosebumps"

Can someone explain the dislikes? Is it just because the material is nothing new?

It's not about being racist but I think the Disney men were wrong with this change because the Ariel cartoon had a lot of impact I don't think this change will help and I emphasize again that I love dark-skinned women a lot

"Disney is moving closer to the original Little Mermaid, trying to grab her while she is hiding under the gutter and screaming.

Guys I Gotta Spread A Message All Of The Criticism Of Ariel Black Is Wrong And These Guys Just Love Their Good Ol White Character For This Movie Can We Just Say Fuck White People In Movies Tradition Even If It's Black Or White It Depends How They Will Grow In Us And How Good There Acting Is Bc Even If their White It's Not Good If it's Doesn't Suit Those Standards
It was a good movie before this.
"""Global warming"" is doing something to the wild life living in the ocean üòâ"

Yo la quiero ver üò¢
"I love that part when Ariel said, ""holy cricket, youre Harry Potter!"". It is a life changing moment."
There is something wrong with my phone or the YouTube app.  My contrast must be broken or something.  Something is wrong with Ariel's color.  I am going to Uninstall the app and reinstall.
Disney will put a skin lightening filter on Halle for China.
"the part where the little mermaid said ""the real little mermaid are the friends we made along the way"" and little mermaided away sent shivers down my spine, everyone in the the theater gave it a standing ovation for 5 hours and then the mayor gave me keys to the city. truly one of the movies ever made."
"La parte donde Ariel dice: ""Mr Anderson, welcome back"" simplemente √©pica."
'lil Mermaid.
The little woke mermaid
The part where little mermaid says ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt nobody got time for dat‚Äù was truly amazing. Disneys eloquence is unmatched.
"After over 30 yrs, Disney says ""oops not so fast, you're not getting the red haired princess that you dreamt about as kids, nope.""
Maybe, Disney should consider renaming this something like ""The Lil' Mermaid of Atlakanda"" (The Mernation of the Wakanda Seas) and name her Aliyah or something cos thats not the Ariel all the lil girls sang along with. Completely unecessary, lazy, race swap. Sorry.
WE LOVE blacks thats why Wakanda was so beloved. And the characters can never be white. There ARE black mermaid tales that need to be known. You have just violated your beloved Ariel and the whole of Atlantis."
"The part where Ariel told Ursula ‚Äú let‚Äôs do each other‚Äôs revenge ‚Äú was epic, most movie of all time"
"why is she blk?
the tale is about a wyt mermaid.

stop race swapping and make your own tales.
...or make me a zulu king with my harem of blk wmn."
Not even surprised anymore after Edward played Batman
"Try to make a original movie and not have original movies made by pixar, starwars, marvel, etc (impossible)"
Looks like theres some bot comments here. Ariel has the eye spacing to look like a fish so good actor choice.
"Why would you turn such an amazing movie into a virtue signal?
Come up with a new story for once."

I loved the part where they identified as merself. Talk about brave! Disney is the best.
I liked the part when she said Ponyo was better remake.
"The part when Eric said ""I'm the prince"" then Ariel replied ""I'm all the fish"" was very wild. Truly an experience in a lifetime."

Coloquen dislike para que Disney aprenda qu√© cambiando las cosas nunca encajara con lo verdadero!
This is such an old movie I can't even remember how it went.  Is this the part where Ursula truns into the little mermaid?
The part where Ariel starts an Only Fans to sell fin pics was so empowering
"If all films and TV used to be dominated by some patriarchal white supremecists or something, then can we not just go back to that? I could live with their odious politics as long as they keep it out of the product. You must admit that they made better stuff. Bring back the patriarchy I say, all is forgiven!"

"It is horrible. Ariel was my favorite princess. This actress may be good, but it is not a good fit for the character. She looks like Medusa instead. I am canceling Disney plus, I am tired of the force inclusion, it ruins everything."
Apa sih the part the part üòÖüòÖ
Wish Disney would filter the comments so it wasn‚Äôt filled with passive-aggressive hate.
"The part where Ariel says :

""Last dance

"Wow, so many bots. How many ""shivers down my spine"" comments are there? Stop buying likes Disney. And also? Just make a new story. Stop race and gender swapping and creating division. Write new stories, great stories. Make new heroes and heroines who are black or latino or asian or Native American instead of giving them crumbs and cast-offs of other properties."

"I think the thing you people defending the movie in the comments needs to understand is that we‚Äôre not angry she‚Äôs black(well some of us that aren‚Äôt racist that is), we‚Äôre angry because the original character was changed. I don‚Äôt hate black characters, I don‚Äôt care what the skin color is. I do hate it when they change the original character I liked though into a different race than their original. It would be the same thing if they were to change lets say Tiana from Princess and the Frog to a white character. Ik there are probably people that genuinely hate black people, but some of us don‚Äôt wanna see our characters get warped and changed when disney can easily make an original black character which we would all support. Did anyone complain about Tiana being black? No."

2) mermaid is an underwater monster, which eats human, they are ugly and evil

about this film, hmmm which one was it... hard to tell"
It was supposed to be little mermaid  not Frankenstein
"Just a few questions from me.
So Triton is son of Poseidon making Ariel Greek in heritage.
But wait she's a half fish (mermaid) so do they even have a prescribed ethnicity? But wait again why is there a Caribbean lobster called Sebastian. But wait again, what is Agrabah, what are these Turkish Persian people, isn't Alladin from China. I guess Disney is just doing what Disney do"

That thought itself is discriminatory."
"""CONFLICTED?!!!"" (with a rabbit-like face twitch)"
Can't believe it there fighting over a movie.
"I love when Ariel says ""It‚Äôs all wrong, By rights we shouldn‚Äôt even be here. But we are. It‚Äôs like in the great stories Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were, and sometimes you didn‚Äôt want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy. How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad happened. But in the end, it‚Äôs only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant something. Even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didn‚Äôt. Because they were holding on to something."" Then Flounder replies with ""What are we holding on to, Sam?""  Then Ariel replies stoically ""That there‚Äôs some good in this world, Mr. Frodo. And it‚Äôs worth fighting for."""

But if you don't believe in God, just scroll on by."

"As a millenial I grew up in the Golden Era of Disney's animated princesses. For whatever reason I was OBSESSED with ALLADIN. I never realised why until I became an adult. It was the first time I saw a Disnesy Princes and Prince with darker skin. I cried when this trailer dropped, because my little ten-year-old heart needed this and my adult heart still needs it. To be more than the boxes society confines us into is paramount. This looks amazing and I am going to take my Black and Brown nieces to see it.THANK YOU Disney."

"Shes so beautiful and idk why but when I read the book as a child I always imagined Ariel as an outcast trying so hard to fit in, for the sake of the one she loved.

You colonizers need to get out of your feelings.
"I have noticed and a lot of other people probably have too that Disney has stopped creating original movies, of course all of the companies and franchises they have bought (marvel, Star Wars, Pixar etc.) are still creating original stuff but the original Disney company has basically just stopped . Nowadays they are just getting the classic movies from back when Disney was at its prime remade which makes them look like desperately trying to get it to appeal to a younger generation, I personally believe that the younger generation also deserves new and original movies and that they should leave the classics how they were. I personally believe that Disney should start to create original movies again that will appeal to and younger generation and who knows the main company might just get more popular than they were a few years ago, just think the new Aladdin movie was popular and got a lot of money but it was forgotten, then think about Moana, that was a huge success and made loads of money and now it‚Äôs a classic. Yeah people enjoy the remakes mostly but when they create original movies where people don‚Äôt know what will happen next or that big plot twist like how Disney used to, the films turn out way better."
I can't understand for the life of me why so many colonizers have a problem with this trailer and movie.

"This trailer doesn't show you anything about the movie other than Ariel is black and there's some nice scenery. If it could show me literally anything exciting or interesting, maybe I'd want to see this, but it does nothing that a trailer is supposed to do. That being said, I still liked the part where Ariel told Isildur to throw the ring into the fire."

U fear replacement & just because they want to diversify & be inclusive challenges u! Evil? Let‚Äôs discuss evil! Ppl like u are evil & dismissive to others! The fact that the status quo has changed u feel empty in a since like someone is taking from u!

"You have to cast ""Princess"" to cast ""Fish"" It's true black washing If I were a racist, I would gladly be a racist.The ""Ariel"" I know isn't that kind of thing.
In the novel, Ariel is clearly described as a white leg when he turns into a human being. Fish falls out and brings a real princess."
Yup.... Fan baiting I see
Nah I‚Äôm fed up with Disney remakes too be politically correct give it a rest
That's sad.... üò™
"There is no need for a 100% adaption of the former arielle. i was a bit confused at first, bc Disneys arielle is white with red hair. but why is it a bad thing that there is now a white arielle and a black arielle? two different interpretations. and the new arielle seems to be as lovely as our cartoon arielle. can't wait for the movie. hopefully it is a good one. remakes tend to be horrible.. so far beauty and the beast was the only good one (but I love Emma, so maybe just bc of her) and cinderella was the absolute worst. I wasn't even able to watch it til the end üòÜ."

The entire staff was drunk at the process of making this

The part where they have to decrease contrast to match her better to the original character.

"I'm used to underwater scenes that are blurred and just... blue, so monotonous that you can't wait to go back to dry land to see the colors as they are. But here, everything is clear.

"The part where Ariel sings ""My Jolly Sailor Bold"" sends shiver down my spine. Truly one of the scene ever."

The part when Ariel said ‚ÄúBond Burger‚Äù it sent chills down my spine.
"Maybe Ariel should be a dutch man since 
The Little Mermaid¬†was written after the marriage of his close friend, Edvard Collin. Andersen wrote love letters to Collin containing sentiments such as, ‚ÄòI long for you, yes, this moment I long for you as if you were a lovely girl‚Ä¶ My sentiments for you are those of a woman. The femininity of my nature and our friendship must remain a mystery‚Äô.¬†The fact that Collin didn‚Äôt reciprocate these feelings was a cause of great distress for Andersen. Themes of melancholy and a longing to be part of something out of reach were present in Andersen‚Äôs personal life, and are reflected in his writing, particularly in¬†The Little Mermaid.

"Really Amazing, just epic and awesome to watch this trailer, no other words. A consumerist masterpiece that shows the function of a capitalist world built off of the cinema and film industry. In every moment of the trailer fills up with action, not only from the main character. It should win an Oscar for its screenplay. The fantastic factors might be from the hyper-filled fight scenes like Ariel and Ursula , Or the magnificent plot. The plot involves a mermaid. Amazing plot right? Whoever thought this should deserves a medal. This is the best live-action of the 21st century. Easily beats every movie in its path. This movie made me dedicated to my present job, being a Mermaid. An antagonist is also a Fat lady with tentacles, Any person caught making the wrong face gets eliminated. the climax is the fellow Ariel coming in to save the day. after I watched trailer I felt something I had never felt before. Pure 100% joy. This film needs a follow-up ASAP. I have never in my life seen a better trailer. The film's soundtrack consists of works better than other movies. I felt like I was in the world of mermaid with all the realistic details around the landscape. This movie grasps its audience and does not let go. The captivating story, the amazing music, the idea of the movie itself, the screenplay, landscape, atmosphere, random details from the comics, and Easter eggs of the Ariel this cute all of those reasons mentioned are just SOME of why I love this traler. The trailer is fantastic, and I love Ariel singing during the middle of the trailer  A critic's DREAM.. As a consumerist, I don't mind this! This movie is gonna be enjoyable it feels as if you are flying to your happy place! 10/10. A modern classic that in the future will be looked at as nostalgia! This trailer is too good to look over. It's insane how the director can make this good of a movie!My emotions went insane for this movie! I can not believe how they made a movie about mermaid turn into an entertainment powerhouse! I love mermaids I want to be a mermaid so much, I love it! Ariel  is so cool I love it!. Morbius literally has so many stunning backgrounds it's amazing! I love this trailer so much!"

Racism may never go away ,but it just makes the people that are racist seem like idiots for  supporting a cause that has no true reason behind it.

"Hasn't Disney learned that these live action remakes pale in comparison to animated classics. They amount to sensory overload when the focus should be on the story and music. Come up with something new and imaginative and stop riding on the coat tails of the last generation's genius. Fly little birds, come up with something for this generation.

That said, I did love when Ariel said ""In this great future, you can't forget your past, that's why I say, no mermaid no cry"" , then merman Georgie made the fire light.  

It sent shivers down my spine."
